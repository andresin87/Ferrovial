"texto1": "The Guadarrama mountain range is a Natural Protected Area and no intermediate stages were allowed for the construction. Therefore four tunnel boring machines (TBMs) were used, two for each tunnel. That the reason why the main project was divided into 4 sections. Ferrovial Agroman was responsible for the construction of sections 3 and 4 (two stretches of approximately 13.37 km and 15.03 km from the northern mouths of both the north and southbound tunnels).<br /><br /> Each of the TBMs, two working from the south entrance in Madrid and the other two from the north entrance in Segovia, advanced at an average pace of 16 meters per day; close to 1,000 meters were excavated in one month. At the same time as the boring process advanced, the TBMs installed the voussoir rings that make up the internal tunnel lining.<br /><br /> The project includes the construction of two cut-and-cover tunnels of 211 m length."
