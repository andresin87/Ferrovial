"texto1": "The diversity of formations to be crossed during the driving of the tunnels has made it necessary to design a wide range of structural elements to line the tunnels. The formations of shaley nature are susceptible of “squeezing” during the excavation and this together with the deep cover has revealed very important forces in the calculation models which require strong construction solutions. Ferrovial Agroman have opted to employ a single ring thickness for their TBMs (50 cm) by increasing the characteristic strength of the concrete in accordance with the predicted stresses: 40, 60, 80 and 110 Mpa."
