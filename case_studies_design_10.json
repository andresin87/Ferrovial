"texto": "The voussoirs are manufactured at the same worksite. Each of the four tunnelling machines is assured of its supply by its own manufacturing plant. Rocks from the excavation were used in their manufacture. This way almost 30% of the material excavated was used for the manufacture of concrete in the voussoir plants. The rest was disposed of in dump sites authorized by the environmental authorities."

"texto": "The diameter of the excavation made by the TBMs is approximately 9.5 m which is reduced to 8.5 meters once it is covered by the voussoir ring, which is 32 cm thick and 1.60 m length. The TBM allows the excavation to proceed at the same time as the putting into place of a prefabricated reinforced cement lining. Each ring or segment of the tunnel is made up of 7 voussoirs."

During the construction process itself these galleries are bored every 1000 meters to guarantee worker safety. The emergency room will be in the middle of the tunnel, between the two tubes. It will be 500 m long, with room for 1,200 people."
