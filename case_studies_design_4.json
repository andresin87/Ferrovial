High structures with large spans were constructed with precast segments; low structures with large spans were full-width single beams with exterior prestressing; and moderate span structures had U beams with compression slabs."

Despe’s main span of 185 m is now the longest in Portugal and possibly longer then any beam spans that have been constructed in Spain. The gorge is the deepest in the Portuguese Archipelago of the Azores."
